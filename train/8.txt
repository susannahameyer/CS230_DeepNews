Ford Stadium in Dallas , Texas on Saturday Sept. 17 , 2016 . SMU won the game 29-14 . ( Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News ) There is no question that SMU is on the rise . The Mustangs improved from one of the worst teams in the nation to a bowl contender this season under head coach Chad Morris . With a plethora of underclassmen on its roster , SMU is poised for an even bigger year in 2017 . In fact , USA Today 's Paul Mayberg spoke to a number of Clemson players and assistants and the consensus seemed to be that Morris can help SMU turn things around just like he did at Clemson . `` SMU is beginning to see what Morris brought to the table for Clemson , if in fits and starts , '' Mayberg wrote . `` After winning just two games in 2015 , his debut season , the Mustangs came within a victory of bowl eligibility this season , an impressive bounce highlighted by a marquee victory against Houston . `` There is a consensus among those players and coaches who know Morris best , from Watson through the Tigers ' current offensive assistants : What he helped build at Clemson will be replicated , if on a smaller scale , at SMU . '' Morris served as the offensive coordinator at Clemson before arriving on the Hilltop . He will enter his third season as head coach at SMU this fall .
